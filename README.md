# IPO-Underpricing-Prediction-and-Financial-Data-Analysis

Project Overview
This project explores the determinants of Initial Public Offering (IPO) underpricing by analyzing financial data from over 600 U.S. companies. It investigates the relationship between management sentiment, extracted from the Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) sections of IPO prospectuses, and pre- and post-IPO valuations. The project follows the CRISP-DM framework and focuses heavily on advanced data preparation, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Extensive preprocessing including handling missing data, normalization, and standardization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and statistical exploration of key IPO dataset features.
Sentiment Analysis: Extracted and analyzed management sentiment from the MD&A sections to predict IPO performance.
Predictive Modeling: Applied Logistic Regression and other advanced statistical techniques to predict IPO underpricing.

Introduction
Understanding the pricing strategies and factors influencing IPO underpricing is crucial for investors. This project leverages financial data to predict underpricing by focusing on the sentiment expressed in the management's IPO prospectus and other significant financial indicators.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset consists of successful U.S. IPOs from more than 600 companies. The following steps were taken in data preprocessing:

Handled missing data through imputation techniques.
Normalized continuous variables to follow a normal distribution.
Standardized features for effective model performance.
Conducted feature engineering to enhance the dataset with additional meaningful variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed descriptive statistics and visual analysis to explore key trends in the IPO dataset:

Visualized distributions of key financial metrics.
Investigated relationships between sentiment scores and IPO valuation.
Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was conducted on the MD&A sections of the IPO prospectuses:

Extracted management sentiment using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Analyzed sentiment polarity and its impact on IPO valuations.
Predictive Modeling
Used Logistic Regression as the primary model for predicting IPO underpricing. The CRISP-DM framework was applied to guide the data mining process and ensure a structured workflow:

Model evaluated using F1-score and AUC metrics.
Additional feature selection and correlation analysis were performed to optimize the model.
Results
The project provided insights into how management sentiment and other key financial factors impact IPO valuations. Key results include:

Effective prediction of IPO underpricing based on sentiment analysis.
Identification of strong predictors for IPO performance.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data preparation and sentiment analysis in predicting IPO underpricing. By applying advanced modeling techniques and the CRISP-DM framework, the project enhances our understanding of how management sentiment influences post-IPO performance.
